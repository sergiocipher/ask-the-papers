# 🎯 Problem Statement

Researchers, students, and professionals face a common challenge:

> Information overload.

A literature review often requires reading dozens of papers, extracting important findings, comparing methodologies, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement, and finally producing a coherent summary.

This process is:

* Time-consuming
* Repetitive
* Difficult to scale
* Prone to missing important insights

The AI Research Synthesis Engine automates this workflow by:

1. Discovering relevant research papers.
2. Extracting structured claims from papers.
3. Comparing findings across sources.
4. Detecting consensus and conflicts.
5. Generating a structured research brief.

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

The AI Research Synthesis Engine is designed to transform research papers into actionable knowledge.

Instead of reading dozens of papers manually, users can:

* Search for relevant papers
* Upload research PDFs
* Extract findings automatically
* Identify research trends
* Generate structured literature-review style briefs

The system emphasizes:

✅ Claim Extraction

✅ Cross-Paper Synthesis

✅ Consensus Detection

✅ Citation Traceability

✅ Research Brief Generation

---

# ✨ Features

## 📚 Research Paper Discovery

Search academic papers from arXiv using natural language research queries.

Example:

```text
How can RAG reduce hallucinations in LLMs?
```

---

## 📄 PDF Ingestion

Upload research papers directly into the platform.

Capabilities:

* PDF parsing
* Page extraction
* Structured document processing

---

## ✂️ Intelligent Chunking

Research papers are divided into manageable semantic chunks.

Benefits:

* Improved LLM performance
* Reduced context window usage
* Better retrieval quality

---

## 🧠 Claim Extraction

Extracts structured research claims including:

* Findings
* Limitations
* Hypotheses
* Future Work

Example:

```json
{
  "claim": "RAG reduced hallucinations by 35%",
  "claim_type": "finding",
  "page_number": 5,
  "chunk_id": "chunk_14"
}
```

---

## 🔍 Semantic Search

Uses vector embeddings to retrieve semantically similar claims.

Example:

Query:

```text
hallucination reduction
```

Can match:

```text
RAG reduces hallucinations
```

even without exact keyword overlap.

---

## 🔗 Cross-Paper Synthesis

Groups similar claims across multiple papers.

Identifies:

* Shared findings
* Emerging themes
* Evidence clusters

---

## 📊 Consensus Detection

Measures agreement across research papers.

Consensus levels:

* Weak
* Moderate
* Strong

---

## 📝 Research Brief Generation

Automatically generates:

* Executive Summary
* Key Findings
* Areas of Consensus
* Areas of Conflict
* Research Gaps
* Future Research Directions

---

## 📌 Citation Traceability

Every extracted claim retains:

* Source paper
* Page number
* Chunk identifier

Ensuring traceable and explainable outputs.

# 🔄 Workflow

## Step 1 — Search Papers

User enters a research question.

Example:

```text
RAG hallucination mitigation
```

System searches arXiv and returns relevant papers.

---

## Step 2 — Upload PDF

User uploads a research paper.

```text
paper.pdf
```

---

## Step 3 — Document Processing

System:

* Extracts pages
* Chunks content
* Preserves citation metadata

---

## Step 4 — Claim Extraction

Claims are extracted using LLMs.

Example:

```json
{
  "claim": "Retrieval improves factual accuracy",
  "claim_type": "finding"
}
```

---

## Step 5 — Semantic Analysis

Claims are embedded and indexed.

Enables:

* Similarity search
* Theme grouping

---

## Step 6 — Synthesis

Related claims are grouped into themes.

Example:

```text
Benefits of Retrieval
```

---

## Step 7 — Research Brief

Final literature-review style report is generated.
